## Description 

It is a simplified version of the classic arcade game Space Invaders 

- Left & Right Arrow: move tank left and right
- Space Bar: fire missiles 

You move tank and fire missiles straight up from its current poisition when you press the space bar. <br />
The invaders appear randomly along the top of the screen and move down on a straight vertical trajectory. <br />
When a missile hits an invader, it destroys it.<br />
The tank has an ammunition supply of 10 missiles and you get a new missile as soon as a previously fired one hits an invader or leaves the canvas from the top edge.<br />
When an invader reaches the bottom or an invader collides with the tank, GAME OVER!<br />
